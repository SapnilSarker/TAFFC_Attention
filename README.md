# An Attention-Based CNN-BiLSTM Architecture for Stress Detection Using Single Channel Electrocardiogram Signal
Stress involves mental tension or anxiety caused by challenging circumstances, prompting people to confront inherent adversities. When a threat is perceived, physiological processes prepare the nervous system, hence the body, to adopt and an early manifestation of this is changes in cardiac rhythm, which is detectable through an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)-based methods can capture these changes, but existing methods suffer from computational and performance efficiency. This work proposes a novel attention mechanism-based convolutional neural network-bidirectional long short-term memory architecture to detect stress automatically using ECG. The performance of the proposed model has been validated on two publicly available datasets, WESAD (WD) and Vollmer (VD), where it highly performed in several metrics, including F1-score (WD: 99.6%, VD: 93%), accuracy (WD: 99.7%, VD: 93.1%), sensitivity (WD: 99.2%, VD: 91.4%), specificity (WD: 100%, VD: 94.8%), and precision (WD: 100%, VD: 94.6%). The performance exhibited by the proposed model on two distinct datasets underscores its capability to automate stress detection using ECG signals, with potential applications in wearable devices.
